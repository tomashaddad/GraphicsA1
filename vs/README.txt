All features implemented except for Asteroids splitting into two when they
explode.

Code is based off of the codebase you provided, so it should work straight away
with Visual Studio.

These are commented and can be uncommented for your convenience:
	Space bar to shoot bullets (in case you have no mouse)
	Right click to grab and move the ship rather than use the arrow keys
	Ship radius drawing code to see warning and collision radii

All features are customisable via the Constants headers.
